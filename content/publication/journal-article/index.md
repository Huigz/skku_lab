abstract: >-
  Over several years of recent efforts to make sense and detect online hate
  speech, we still know relatively little about how hateful expressions enter
  online platforms and whether there are patterns and features characterizing
  the corpus of hateful speech.


  In this research, we introduce a new conceptual framework suitable for better capturing the overall scope and dynamics of the current forms of online hateful speech.


  We adopt several Python-based crawlers to collect a comprehensive data set covering a variety of subjects from a multiplicity of online communities in South Korea. We apply the notions of marginalization and polarization in identifying patterns and dynamics of online hateful speech.


  Our analyses suggest that polarization driven by political orientation and age difference predominates in the hateful speech in most communities, while marginalization of social minority groups is also salient in other communities. Furthermore, we identify a temporal shift in the trends of online hate from gender to age based, reflecting the changing sociopolitical conditions within the polarization dynamics in South Korea.


  By expanding our understanding of how hatred shifts and evolves in online communities, our study provides theoretical and practical implications for both researchers and policy-makers.
